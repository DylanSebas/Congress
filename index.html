                            The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country,
                            although its bills must also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S.
                            President
                            before becoming law (unless both the House and Senate re-pass the legislation with a
                            two-thirds
                            majority in each chamber). The House has some exclusive powers: the power to initiate
                            revenue
                            bills, to impeach officials (impeached officials are subsequently tried in the Senate), and
                            to
                            elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College.

                            Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population as measured in
                            the
                            census, but every state is entitled to at least one representative.

                                        <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and
                                            susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the
                                            Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine
                                            of
                                            state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
                                            formal
                                            legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
                                            Sweden,
                                            for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory)
                                            enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the
                                            Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly,
                                            is
                                            strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                                            sphere.

                                            Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and
                                            France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements
                                            for
                                            public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
                                            articles.
                                            In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back
                                            on
                                            these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                                            politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.

                                            Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                                            democratic
                                            practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information
                                            legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom
                                            of
                                            information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
                                            eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
                                            gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                                            Documents
                                            in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).

                                            The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966,
                                            FOIAs,
                                            Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark
                                            and
                                            Norway in 1970.</p>
